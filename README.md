# CNN using MNIST dataset
* Convolutional Neural Network</b> is a very famous and effective algorithm in supervised machine learning.
* In this repository I have trained a model to detect hand written digits by using very famous MNIST dataset.
* I have trained the model by using two different structure and recorded good difference in both models.
* Models has approx <b>98.77%</b> and <b>99.01%</b> accuracy.
